You can add content in two ways:<ul><li>Write it yourself</li><li>Use the instruction wizard to generate an additional instruction with your input</li></ul>Tip: use the instruction wizard the first time to see what an additional instruction might look like. You can always adjust this manually later.<br><br>Note: In 'What can a user enter themselves' you can add 'free questions' for users. These are questions that are asked to the user at the start of a conversation. This allows cases to be tailored to the user's situation. If you want to use that, only give instructions here that always apply to your case (and are not contradictory or limiting to the information in the free questions).<br><br>Note: The instruction wizard only works if a conversation type has been chosen, because the required input differs per conversation type. The conversation type can be chosen under 'Basics'.<br><br>Important: write your instructions as an order to the AI.
